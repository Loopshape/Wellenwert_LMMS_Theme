DESCRIPTION: 

>>> Wellenwert – LMMS Theme <<< 

Gratulation for downloading the colorful "Wellenwert" theme for LMMS! 
I hope you'll be happy with this awesome colors, as I'm doing. 
I've modified icons and created a colorful palette with a widen spectrum of all possible color-values that could be combined together!!! 
This theme is based originally on another "dark" theme from another author, 
that was modified by me with a recolored icon-stack and a modified CSS-scriptfile, that belongs also to the package. 

...enjoy!

DISCLAIMER: 

> Some credits goes out to the original creator of the dark theme, that the "Wellenwert – LMMS Theme" is based on. 
> I have to search the original theme out of the LMMS.io website first, then I can say, which theme was chosen... sorry!
