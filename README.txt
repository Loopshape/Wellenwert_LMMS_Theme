DESCRIPTION: 

>>> Wellenwert – LMMS Theme <<< 

Gratulation for downloading the colorful "Wellenwert" theme for LMMS! 
I hope you'll be happy with this awesome colors, as I'm doing. 
I've modified icons and created a colorful palette with a widen spectrum of all possible color-values that could be combined together!!! 
This theme is based originally on another "dark" theme from another author, 
that was modified by me with a recolored icon-stack and a modified CSS-scriptfile, that belongs also to the package. 

...enjoy! 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've added some automation-scripts for the bash-shell! 
If you want to use these scripts for compiling, zipping and extracting the theme-folder, 
please install Node.JS first: 

> sudo apt-get update -y [ENTER]
> sudo apt-get install -fy sudo gksu nano nodejs-legacy npm zip unzip [ENTER]
> sudo npm i -g n [ENTER]
> sudo n latest [ENTER]
> sudo npm i -g npm [ENTER]
> sudo npm i -g compass sass less fis-parser-node-sass-qt [ENTER]

...when all commands are executed, then all needed files were installed for compiling. 
You can now start to modifiy the ".scss" file in the LMMS_Theme folder and compile it via
the predefined automation-scripts in the main theme-folder.

DISCLAIMER: 

> Some credits goes out to the original creator of the dark theme, that the "Wellenwert – LMMS Theme" is based on. 
> I have to search the original theme out of the LMMS.io website first, then I can say, which theme was chosen... sorry!
